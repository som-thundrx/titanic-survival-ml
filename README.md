# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression Project

This project demonstrates the use of basic data science techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using logistic regression.

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived or not using features like age, class, sex, and embarkation port.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Logistic regression model building
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report

## 📈 Accuracy
Achieved ~75% accuracy on the test dataset.
